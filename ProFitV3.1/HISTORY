   V0.1   25.09.92 Original
   V0.2   02.10.92 Added CURSES support
   V0.3   07.10.92 Added Amiga windows and paging support
   V0.4   09.10.92 Added N&W alignment support & fixed bug in multi-zones
   V0.5   08.10.93 Various tidying for Unix & chaned for booklib 
   V0.6   05.01.94 Modified MDMFILE for Unix getenv()
                   More tidying
                   Reads HELPDIR and DATADIR environment variables under 
   V0.7   24.11.94 Uses ReadPDBAtoms()
                   The DATAENV environment variable is now handled by code
                   in bioplib/align.c/ReadMDM; Checks the return from 
                   ReadMDM(). Fixed bug in multi-zone align.
                   Some ammendments to ProFit.help to explain the use
                   of chain names in ZONE specifications.
   V0.8   17.07.95 Fixed bugs in multi-chain fitting. Chain name must
                   come *before* residue number. Removed windowing code.
   V1.0   19.07.95 Allows inserts in structures including insert names
                   in zones. Allows HETATM records to be included.
                   HETATMs are not read by default. However, by putting
                   a -h on the command line, or giving the HETATOM
                   command you may get ProFit to read HETATM
                   records. The extraction of sequence now ignores
                   HETATM records, so the problem with the ALIGN
                   command when there were HETATMs should have gone
                   away.  There is now a RESIDUE command which gives a
                   by-residue RMS over the current RATOMS and RZONE
                   (ATOMS/ZONE if RATOMS/RZONE unspecified).  If you
                   are reading commands into ProFit from a file rather
                   than from the keyboard, you no longer get loads of
                   ProFit> prompts appearing in your output which
                   tidies things up a bit. An end of file also ends the
                   ProFit program, so you no longer *need* to put QUIT
                   in the command file.
   V1.1   20.07.95 Added WEIGHT/NOWEIGHT commands
                   Added translation to MATRIX output
   V1.1a  21.07.95 Fixed core dump when trying to write unfitted file
   V1.2   22.07.95 Added GAPPEN command
          25.07.95 Added printing of chain labels in Status
                   Bioplib's three->one translation now handles nucleic 
                   acids.
                   RESIDUE command takes optional filename parameter to
                   direct output to a file.
   V1.3   31.07.95 Fixed bug in ZONE command when end of zone=end of chain
                   which was not the last chain.
                   Prints number of residues in zones when a mismatch
                   occurs.
                   Potential out-of-bounds memory access fixed in weights
                   array.
   V1.4   14.08.95 Fixed printing by residue which was not printing the 
                   last residue.
   V1.5   21.08.95 Fixed bug in creating zones from NW alignment when last
                   zone != end of chain. Also fixed bug in Bioplib/align.c
                   which was messing up the end of an alignment.
          24.08.95 Fixed a bug in Bioplib/align.c which caused potential
                   core dumps when an amino acid type not in the MDM matrix
                   was found. This should never cause a problem in ProFit
                   since these junk characters are never generated.
-------- 
          27.09.95 Updated profit.hlp which still said insert codes are
                   not allowed in ZONEs
   V1.5a  02.10.95 Added centre of geometry data to output of the MATRIX
                   command and updated profit.hlp with this information.
   V1.5b  15.11.95 Prints score normalised by shorter sequence length
                   as well as matrix maximum score.
                   Updated profit.hlp which said numeric zones could be 
                   specified as a single residue.
   V1.6   20.11.95 Added READALIGNMENT command.
--------
   V1.6a  21.11.95 Fixed a couple of warnings under gcc
   V1.6b  22.11.95 Modified code in SetNWZones() such that deletions at
                   the same position in both sequences don't cause a 
                   problem. This was only a problem if an alignment was
                   read using READALIGNMENT which had a deletion in both
                   sequences.
   V1.6c  13.12.95 Fix 1.6b wasn't working if a double deletion occurred
                   in the middle of a long run of deletions
   V1.6d  24.01.96 Fixed bug in STATUS command when atom names contain
                   spaces. Modifications to docs.
                   Error reporting improved: no atoms read from PDB files
                   distinguished from no memory.
                   Fixed bioplib bug in converting an all HETATM file to
                   sequence.
   V1.6e  31.05.96 Added BVALUE command
   V1.6f  13.06.96 Added BWEIGHT command
   V1.6g  18.06.96 Internal changes only --- replaced FindZone() by
                   FindZonePDB() in Bioplib
   V1.7   23.07.96 Some tidying of comments
                   Fixed potential out-of-bounds array errors in atom 
                      specifications
                   Added atom wildcard specifications
                   Various internal tidying and reorganisation of code
                   Bugs and potential crashes fixed:
                     a) When setting zones from a PIR alignment file, used 
                        to fail if there were deletions in both sequence.
                     b) STATUS command didn't work properly if atom names 
                        contained spaces.
                     c) Used to crash if you tried to use ALIGN on a file 
                        which contained no amino acids.
                     d) Used to crash if you specified atom names of more 
                        than 7 characters or more than 50 atom names
                  Error reporting improved: no atoms read from PDB files 
                     distinguished from no memory.
                  New features:
                     a) BVALUE command: Allows a cutoff to be applied to 
                        B-values; atom pairs where the atoms from either 
                        structure has a B-value above this value are ignored
                     b) BWEIGHT command: Weights the fitting by the inverse 
                        of the B-value such that mobile atoms are less 
                        heavily weighted.
                     c) Atom name specifications may now include wildcards
--------
   V1.7a  06.11.96 Added -ve values for BVALUE
                   Added IGNORE/NOIGNORE
   V1.7b  11.11.96 Added REF and MOB options to BVALUE keyword to allow
                   only one to be examined rather than an average
   V1.7c  18.11.96 Added IGNOREMISSING option
   V1.7d  20.12.96 Added NFITTED command
                   Fixed a bug in bioplib/ReadPDB() which would cause
                   completely blank lines in a PDB file to produce data 
                   from the previous line.
   V1.7e  27.06.97 Added ability to output from RESIDUE and WRITE to
                   a pipe.
   V1.7f  03.07.97 Added break into CreateFitArrays() to fix core dump
                   on bad multiple-occupancy PDB files. If the 'same'
                   atoms don't appear immediately next to eachother
                   (they should), then all are read by ReadPDB() and
                   this routine was then comparing all with all.
                   Also warns of multiple occupancies on reading file.
                   Changed to use CD1 for ILE rather than CD.
   V1.7g  06.05.98 Complete rewrite of NWAlign/SetNWZones(). The new
                   version is much simpler; it also fixes a bug which
                   occurred following 1-residue zones.
   V1.8   07.05.98 Release of V1.7g
                   1. New features:
                      a) The BVALUE command now takes a negative value
                         to reverse the sense of the cutoff and can
                         also be restructed to reference or mobile
                         structures rather than using an average 
                      b) New option to ignore missing atoms
                      c) Added NFITTED command to show number of fitted atoms
                      d) RESIDUE and WRITE commands can now output to a pipe
                   2. Bug fixes:
                      a) Completely blank lines in a PDB file caused
                         the previous line to be repeated
                      b) Multiple-occupancy PDB files where the 'same'
                         atoms didn't appear next to eachother in the
                         file caused a core dump 
                      c) ILE C-delta correctly written as CD1 rather than CD
                      d) Zone setting from sequence alignment had a
                         bug with single residue zones
                   3. Internal changes:
                      a) Complete rewrite of the zone setting based on
                         sequence alignment. 
--------
   V2.0   01.03.01 Added support for multiple structure fitting and 
                   iterative zone updating. Output atom names now exactly
                   match input names. Can write coordinates with centre
                   of geometry of fitted region at the origin. Added QUIET
                   option. Added LIMIT command to restrict region read from
                   an alignment to create fitting zones.
                   (not publicly released)
   V2.1   28.03.01 Added cutoff parameter for ITERATE and added CENTRE
                   command
                   (not publicly released)
   V2.2   20.12.01 Fixed some Bioplib problems related to raw atom names
                   and multiple occupancies
                   1. New features:
                      a) Now supports fitting of multiple
                         structures. Each structure is fitted to the
                         reference and the average coordinates are
                         calculated. All structures are fitted to the
                         average and the process iterates to convergence. 
                      b) Now supports iterative zone updating. After
                         an initial fit, atom pairs more distant than
                         a cutoff are discarded and atom pairs closer
                         than the cutoff are pulled in. The fitting
                         iterates to convergence  
                      c) Coordinates can be written with centre of
                         geometry of fitted region at the origin
                         instead of translated to the reference set 
                      d) Added QUIET option to switch off warning and
                         informational messages
                      e) Added LIMIT command to restrict the region
                         read from an alignment to create fitting zones
                   2. Internal changes:
                      a) Code now writes the atom names exactly as
                         they were read instead of cleaning them up.
                      b) Some fairly major rewrites to support the
                         multiple structure fitting.
   V2.3   01.12.04 Fixed a bug in reading sequence alignment with multiple
                   structures. Was core-dumping if there were double
                   deletions
   V2.4   03.06.05 Fixed some more Bioplib problems related to raw atom
                   names and multiple occupancies
                   V2.3 and 2.4 are bug fix releases.
                   Bugs fixed were:
                   1. handling of multiple occupancy atoms with new
                      Bioplib code for writing atom names back
                      properly after reading them     
                   2. a core dump on reading alignment files with
                      'double deletions' (i.e. a deletion in both
                      sequences at the same position - when an
                      alignment is grabbed from a multiple alignment file) 
   V2.5   08.06.05 Fixed more related bugs
   V2.5.1 10.06.05 Fixed bug in Bioplib related to getting the sequence from
                   a CA-only chain
   V2.5.2 14.10.05 Enhanced Bioplib/ReadPDB() to cope with corrupt multiple
                   occupancies such as 1zeh/B13
   V2.5.3 06.07.06 Fixed bug in correcting ILE-CD to ILE-CD1 - was writing
                   an extra space.
   V2.5.3.1        Fixed a distribution bug - a file was missing from the
                   V2.5.3 distribution
   V2.5.4 29.06.07 Prototypes in bioplib functions are now conditional
                   for MAC OSX to allow the code to compile
   V2.6   16.06.08 Can centre the fitting on the CofG of a
                   user-specified residue rather than on the fitting
                   zones (SETCENTRE)  
                   Can write the whole of a PDB file instead of just
                   the ATOM/HETATM records (HEADER)
                   Can delete zones (DELZONE/DELRZONE)
                   Can run scripts (SCRIPT)
                   Can specify zones using the B-value column (BZONE)
                   Can print distances between equivalenced atoms (PAIRDIST)
                   Can ignore atom pairs where distance is greater
                   than a cutoff in calculating RMSD (DISTCUTOFF)
                   Can read lower occupancy atoms (OCCRANK)
                   RESIDUE command now indicates atoms either wholly
                   or partly outside any cutoff specified by DISTCUTOFF
                   Handles lower-case chain names
                   Checks for overlapping zones
                   Checks sequences read with READALIGNMENT
   V3.0   28.01.09 Multiple structure fitting now gives RMSD to first mobile
                   structure by default.(SETREF)
                   Calculation of the averaged reference structure for 
                   multiple structure fitting is now weighted by the number of
                   mobile structures.(WTAVERAGE)
                   Can fit multiple structures in order of RMSD.(ORDERFIT)
                   Can run an all vs all comparison of mobile structures.
                   (ALLVSALL)
                   Can match symmetrical atoms.(SYMMATM)
                   Can perform iterative fitting on structures with more than 
                   one chain.
                   Can read PIR alignments with more than one chain.(READALIGN)
                   Can align structures with more than one chain.(ALIGN)
                   Can output fitting zones as an alignment.(PRINTALIGN)
                   Added support for GNU Readline library. 
   V3.1   02.04.09 Windows support
                   Some fixes for NOFIT (clear structures on reading new
                   structure).
                   Added temporary fix to remove padding of input atom names
                   This fixes problems with specifying 3-letter atom names,
                   but still needs some further investigation
